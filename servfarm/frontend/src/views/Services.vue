                                      <p>Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, 
                                      and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese.</p>
                                      <p>Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator
                                       of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that is used by the calculator.</p>

                                      <p>When the blood pressure is very high, it means that the blood circulates exerting excessive pressure on the arteries and, therefore, the heart has to make more effort than normal.</p>

                                      <p>A pregnancy test is done using blood or urine. There are 2 types of blood tests:</p>
                                      <p>- Qualitative, which measures whether the HCG hormone is present;</p>
                                      <p>- Quantitative, which measures how much HCG is present.</p>
                                      <p>The blood test is done by drawing a single tube of blood and sending it to a laboratory. You may wait anywhere from a few hours to more than a day to get the results.</p>
                                      <p>The urine HCG test is most often performed by placing a drop of urine on a prepared chemical strip. It takes 1 to 2 minutes for a result.</p>
                                      <p>For the urine test, you urinate into a cup.
                                      For the blood test, the health care provider uses a needle and syringe to draw blood from your vein into a tube. Any discomfort you might feel from the blood draw will only last a few seconds.</p>
